# API Test Application

A Node app built with MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js (MEAN stack). Based on the Todo app graciously provided by Chris Sevilleja.

Node provides an API to the web app, and accesses the provided API endpoints.

All requests are cached by the server, and in some cases the client, to ensure maximum availability.
